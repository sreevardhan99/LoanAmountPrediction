# Loan Amount Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict loan amounts based on various features such as applicant income, credit history, and other financial parameters. The project uses data analysis and machine learning techniques to build and evaluate predictive models.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset and visualize key trends.
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
- Machine Learning Models: Train and evaluate models to predict loan amounts.
- Results Visualization: Visualize model performance and predictions.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries:

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Loan_Amount_Prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd loan-amount-prediction
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook PROJECTcode.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to:
   - Perform EDA
   - Preprocess data
   - Train and evaluate models
